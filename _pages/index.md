I am currently a scientist in the data science and computation group at [Altos Labs](https://www.altoslabs.com/). Before moving to the Bay Area, I had a short stint at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/) as a senior application engineer in the computational biology group.

I am mostly interested in the intersection of **biology**, **computation**, **modeling** (statistical and first-principle), and **artificial intelligence**. Before pivoting to industry, I obtained a PhD at the University of California San Diego under the supervision of [Prof. David Saintillan](http://stokeslet.ucsd.edu/index.html) in computational biophysics to understand how our genome organizes inside the nucleus of a cell.

Prior to UCSD, I obtained an M.S.(Engg.) degree from Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (Bangalore, India) under the supervision of [Prof. Meheboob Alam](https://www.jncasr.ac.in/faculty/meheboob/) and a B.Tech. degree in Chemical Engineering from National Institute of Technology Karnataka Surathkal.
