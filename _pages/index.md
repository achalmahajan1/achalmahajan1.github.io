I am a currently a scientist in the data science and computation group at <a href="https://www.altoslabs.com/">Altos Labs</a>. Before moving to Bay area, I had a short stint at <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/">MathWorks</a> as a senior application engineer in the computational biology group. 

I am mostly interested in the intersection of biology, computation, modeling (statistical and first principle) and artifical intelligence. Before pivoting to industry, I had obtained a PhD at the University of California San Diego under the supervision of <a href="http://stokeslet.ucsd.edu/index.html">Prof. David Saintillan</a> in computational biophysics to understand how our genome organizes inside the nucleus of a cell. 

Prior to coming to UCSD, I have obtained an M.S.(Engg). degree from Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (Bangalore, India) under the supervision of <a href="https://www.jncasr.ac.in/faculty/meheboob/">Prof. Meheboob Alam</a> and a B.Tech. degree in Chemical Engineering from National Institute of Technology Karnataka Surathkal.
